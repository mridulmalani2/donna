## "Why Now?" Reasoning: Margaret Chen

### Urgency Explanation (Priority Score 94)

Margaret Chen has a priority score of 94, placing her in your top tier. Several factors contribute:

1. **Panic Indicator Active**: Recent market volatility in tech has triggered significant anxiety

2. **High AUM at Risk**: $18.5M portfolio (top 5% of your book)

3. **Unusual Withdrawal Pattern**: Three large withdrawals totaling $2.1M in 45 days

4. **Overdue Check-in**: 7 days since scheduled quarterly review

5. **Red Flag Activity**: Unilateral liquidation of major position without consultation
