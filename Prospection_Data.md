## Governance & Consent Notes

### Relationship-Based Prospection

**Source:** Client relationship and disclosed network information

**Consent Model:**
Network connections surfaced through client relationship context, professional background, and disclosed personal relationships. Direct prospection requires:

1. Stabilized relationship with primary client (Margaret Chen)
2. Appropriate introduction or permission from client
3. Context-appropriate outreach (not cold calling family members)

### Data Privacy Considerations

**Network Data Sources:**
- Client-disclosed information during relationship building
- Professional background and biographical data
- Publicly available business information (IPOs, corporate expansions)
- Inferred relationships from client context

**Restrictions:**
- Family member prospection (David Chen) requires explicit client permission or warm introduction
- Professional network contacts should be approached through thought leadership and education rather than direct solicitation
- Business advisors (James Patterson) require context-appropriate positioning

### Current Status Note

**Margaret Chen Relationship Status:** At-risk

**Prospection Recommendation:**
All prospection activities related to Margaret Chen's network should be suspended until the primary client relationship is stabilized. Attempting to prospect her network while the relationship is strained could:
- Further damage trust with primary client
- Create ethical concerns
- Result in unsuccessful outreach (network may be aware of client's current dissatisfaction)

**Prioritization:**
Retention of $18.5M AUM relationship takes absolute priority over prospection opportunities.
